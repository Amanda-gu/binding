<h2>Project description</h2>
<p>https://typography-interaction-2526.github.io/project/3/</p>
<p>"The goal of this project is to apply the skills you have now developed across multiple web pages⁠—creating your first website. This “book” will include a homepage (its cover), navigation (table of contents), individual pages for each text (chapters), and your introduction (a colophon). It will house your texts and allow a reader to move between them all. The final website will be responsive for mobile, desktop, and print layouts across all the pages."</p>
